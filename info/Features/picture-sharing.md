# Picture Sharing

<div class="container yellow-4-bg gray-9-fg">
<i class="fa-solid fa-flask"></i> <strong>This service is in beta.</strong> It might not work properly all the time, and it will probably change before it’s finalized.
</div>

You’ve got beautiful pictures that you want to share, and we’ve got a place for you to share them. A match made in visual heaven! <i class="fa-solid fa-fw fa-star-shooting"></i>

Our picture sharing service, [some.pics](https://some.pics), does two things:

1. Makes it easy to share your favorite pictures on the internet.
2. Offers a way to add pictures to your weblog.lol site.

The service will soon be in _**extreme beta**_, and when it launches we’d love your feedback (and [bug reports](https://github.com/neatnik/omg.lol/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bugs.yml&title=%5BBug%5D+)).

Currently there aren’t any specific limits associated with the service (in terms of image size or quantity shared), but this will likely change during the beta.

## Features

The focus is on simple public image sharing. If you want to put a picture on the internet and let people see it, this is the service for you! If you want to limit who can see your pictures, this is _not_ the service for you. Features may expand over time, but the core intention of the service is to facilitate sharing nice pictures openly and simply.

## What it isn’t

- It’s not a general cloud photo storage solution.
- It’s not a place to back-up or store an entire photo library.
- It’s not intended for sharing transient screenshots or other temporary/throwaway stuff.

## Community Guidelines

Please note that our guidelines will evolve as this service matures. What you see below was last updated on February 23, 2023.

- Our [Code of Conduct](https://home.omg.lol/info/code-of-conduct) applies here (as well as everywhere else on omg.lol).
- We’re passionate about accessibility, so all pictures must have a description. These descriptions are how some people will “see” your pictures, so you shouldn’t half-ass them! [Learn how to write good image descriptions](https://supercooldesign.co.uk/blog/how-to-write-good-alt-text).
- In general, we’d like to try to keep things family-friendly around here. That doesn’t mean that everything you share has to be squeaky clean or get a nod from Ned Flanders, but it does mean that we’re going to moderate content and may remove things that run far astray (illegal content, gratuitous explicit sexual content, content that promotes drug use or self-harm, etc.). To be clear, most artistic nudity is fine. If you could see it on European television, it’s probably going to be OK here.
- You can share other people’s content here if it’s licensed or you have permission. If someone doesn’t want you to share their content here, please don’t do it. Copyright violations put our service in legal jeopardy, and that’s not cool.

We appreciate you keeping these guidelines in mind when sharing pictures. <i class="fa-regular fa-fw fa-face-smile-halo"></i>
