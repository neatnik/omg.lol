# Your Web Page

omg.lol offers a couple of different ways to manage and host a web page with your omg.lol address. One is a a simple no-frills web page editor, and the other is a profile page management feature.

## Profile Page

Profile pages are a fun and easy way to maintain a web presence. You can share as much or as little information about yourself as you wish, and you’ll still wind up with a really nice-looking page. Use the [Advanced Editor](/info/advanced-editor) to manage your profile.

## Web Page

If you just want to publish a simple web page of your own design, you can do that by toggling your web page type to **Raw HTML only** and using our [Advanced Editor](/info/advanced-editor). When you’re in **Raw HTML only** mode, everything you put into the editor is rendered as your web page.
