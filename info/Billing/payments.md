## Payment processing

We use Stripe to securely process your online payment. Theyâ€™re _the best_.

## Currencies

Stripe is rolling out a new automatic currency conversion program and are adding new currencies all the time. As of now, in addition to USD, payments can be made in EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD, MXN, JPY and SGD. Wow!
