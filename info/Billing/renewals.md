# Renewals

Renewing your omg.lol address is easy! You can add time to your address whenever you’d like. You’ll see the option to add time via your [addresses](/addresses) page (click on the @name you want to extend, then select add time from the purple strip). You can renew for as long as you’d like, up to ten years at a time (but there’s nothing stopping you from adding ten years and then adding more time after that, if you’re determined to go in it for the long haul).

As we mention in our [Billing](/info/billing) article, there is no automatic renewal associated with your omg.lol address. We don’t retain your payment information, so you’re always in control with your renewals. But this also means that you need to remember to renew!

## Renewal Reminders

We send three reminders when an address is approaching expiration:

1. The first one is sent 60 days before expiration.
2. The second is sent 30 days before expiration.
3. The third and final notification is sent 14 days before expiration.

## Address Expiration

When addresses expire, everything associated with them is expunged (including any content, configuration, etc.) and the address is returned to the available address pool. If you’re concerned about your address expiring, be sure to add some time to it in advance of its expiration date.

More information about the expiration process is available on the [Address Expiration](/info/expiration) page.
