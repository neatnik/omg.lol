- [omg.lol](https://omg.lol) is an eTLD registered on the Public Suffix List. The base address redirects to [home.omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol), while other subdomains redirect to either service pages (which would be listed below) or member addresses.
- [home.omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol) is our canonical service domain, and the only domain used for account activity (registration, sign-in, account maintenance, etc.). There are no member-run services operating within this domain.
- [broke.lol](https://broke.lol) is our service status page.

If you have found a location other than the ones above claiming to be affiliated with omg.lol, or if someone has asked you to log into omg.lol or share any personal information at a location other than home.omg.lol, please [email abuse@omg.lol](mailto:abuse@omg.lol) immediately.

## Why does this list exist?

This list exists to help you ensure that you’re only dealing with official, legitimate omg.lol services. (In other words, if someone came along and registered “omg-support-scam.omg.lol” and suggested that you enter your credentials there, this page would confirm that would be a bad idea.)
