# Code of Conduct

To keep our community safe, we have some pretty straightforward ground rules:

- Don’t spread hate or negativity, especially based on people’s fundamental differences such as gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, nationality, age, ability, and social class.
- Don’t harass, troll, seek to offend, or shitpost.
- Don’t spread misinformation, whether your own or someone else’s.
- Don’t be consistently contrarian or engage in frequent devil’s advocacy or whataboutism.
- Don’t be passive-aggressive.
- Don’t share NSFW or other graphic/sensitive content without an appropriate content warning.
- Avoid being excessively lewd or vulgar (we do have minor members).

## Politics and sensitive issues

- Everything is political, and many people have to live with the effects of deeply uncomfortable realities. In this space, no one is ever expected to limit their discussions of politics or other sensitive issues just to make others feel comfortable.
- It’s important to recognize that our community includes people from all walks of life. Not everyone has had the same upbringing or experiences that you have had, and not everyone relates to the world in the same way that you do.

## Handling differences of opinion

- It’s OK to politely disagree with people about matters of opinion. In these disagreements, there are often opportunities to learn new things (both about the topic at hand and about one another).
- When disagreeing over an opinion, make it about the opinion itself and not the person expressing it.
- Opinions are for things like AI, food, and text editors, not fascism or war crimes. Expressing views that support or defend immoral activities or hateful systems of belief will not be tolerated.

## Reporting problems or concerns

If you have a concern about anything that happens in our social spaces, you should report it to a moderator as soon as you can. It’s better to raise concerns promptly so they can be addressed before they turn into larger problems. Promptly reporting issues ensures that our community remains safe for everyone.

You can see all of the ways to report issues on our [moderation page](/info/moderation).
