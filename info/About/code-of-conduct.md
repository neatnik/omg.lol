# Code of Conduct

omg.lol is a loving and inclusive platform. When you use [our services](/info/services), we ask that you always be kind and respectful—or, at the very least, that you strive to do no harm.

More specifically, and most importantly:

- Don’t spread hate or negativity, especially based on people’s fundamental differences such as gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, nationality, age, ability, and social class.
- Don’t harass, troll, seek to offend, shitpost, or otherwise bother anyone.
- Don’t lie, and don’t spread others’ lies or misinformation.

Also:

- Don’t be consistently contrarian or engage in ongoing devil’s advocacy or whataboutism. It doesn’t make you nearly as clever as you think it does; it just makes everyone around you tired and annoyed.
- Don’t be passive-aggressive. It might make you feel better in the short term, but it makes others uncomfortable in the long run. This includes things like talking around an issue instead of addressing it directly and maturely, sub-tweeting/tooting, or engaging in similar behaviors that hurt more than help.
- When interacting with others in our social spaces, avoid being lewd or vulgar. There are children here.

Finally:

- Recognize that our community includes people from all walks of life. Not everyone has had the same upbringing or experiences that you have had, and not everyone relates to the world in the same way that you do.
- Consider being open to feedback or criticism shared in good faith. When someone takes the time to share feedback, it’s because they care about you. When it’s rejected outright, an opportunity to learn and grow is missed.

## “But what about my free speech?”

We believe that everyone has a right to the freedoms of speech and personal expression. We also believe that everyone has a right to live free of abuse, harassment, and harm. In specific situations where these two beliefs are at odds with one another, we prioritize the second over the first.

We’re super serious about this: our platform *will not* be a vehicle for abuse, harassment, or harm of any kind. We do not tolerate people who cause harm to others. If you can’t play nice here, you will have to go play somewhere else.

If you encounter any kind of abuse of our services, please contact [abuse@omg.lol](mailto:abuse@omg.lol). [Learn more about how we respond to abuse complaints.](/info/omg.lol/abuse)
