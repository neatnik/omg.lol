# Address Deletion

You can delete your omg.lol address whenever you’d like. In the Preferences section of your address page, you’ll see a “Delete” button.

If you delete your address, all of its data will be permanently deleted. We process deletions in a GDPR-compliant manner, which means there’s no coming back from a deletion: your data is removed thoroughly, and from everywhere (including backups). Address data cannot be recovered once deleted.
