# Address Expiration

If you choose not to renew your omg.lol address, it will expire. Expired addresses can be recovered within a 14 day period following the expiration, but after that all of the address’s data is deleted in a GDPR-compliant manner and the address itself is returned to the pool of available omg.lol addresses.

Hopefully you would only let your address expire because you decided that you no longer wanted it. To minimize accidents or forgetfulness, we send several reminder emails before your address expires and your data is deleted. Here’s the full schedule:

1. Prior to expiration, an initial renewal notice is sent 30 days before expiration.
2. A second renewal notice is sent 14 days before expiration.
3. A third renewal notice is sent 7 days before expiration.
4. A final renewal notice is sent 3 days before expiration.
5. An initial data deletion notice is sent upon address expiration.
6. A second data deletion notice is sent seven days after expiration (which is halfway through the 14 day recovery period).
7. A third and final data deletion notice is sent 24 hours before all data will be permanently deleted.

Once your address expires, you’ll have a 14 day grace period to access or export any data (or change your mind and renew!). After 14 days, all of your data will be permanently deleted, and your address will be available for someone else to register.

If you have a Mastodon account on social.lol, you can use the 14 day recovery period noted above to migrate your address to another instance. After 14 days, your Mastodon account and all of its data will be permanently deleted. Be sure to migrate your account and/or export any of your Mastodon data prior to its deletion.
