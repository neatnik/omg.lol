# Chat

Connect with your friends (or make new ones) in our awesome omg.lol chat rooms! Our community is smart and kind, and there’s always an interesting conversation happening. Join us!

### Getting Started

To kick things off, just visit your address’s social.lol page (look for the button that says “socialize, lol”). That’s where you can get set up with [IRC](/info/irc), [Discord](/info/irc), [Matrix](/info/matrix), or [XMPP](/info/xmpp). (Mastodon is on there, too, but it’s not typically considered a real-time/live chat thing.)

You’ll need a chat client for whatever chat thing you want to use. Click on any of the links above to learn more.

### Rules

Our [Code of Conduct](/info/code-of-conduct), [Terms of Use](/info/legal), and [Acceptable Use](/info/legal) policies apply when using omg.lol’s chat rooms. Be cool!

### Bridging & Channels

There are a handful of channels covering different topics, all of which are bridged across all of the chat services. This means that you can be on XMPP and chat with people who are on Discord, and people on IRC and Matrix will see those messages too. Bridging isn’t perfect, but it’s a pretty nice way to keep everyone connected despite personal preferences with chat apps/services.

Here are the channels you’ll find within the omg.lol Chat Network:

  * **#general**, General chatter on just about anything
