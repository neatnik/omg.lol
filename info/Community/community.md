# About Our Community

The omg.lol community is a small group of people from [all over the world](https://home.omg.lol/map) who love the web. We have plenty of other things in common, too, but we‚Äôre mainly united in our collective appreciation of awesome websites and the many neat pages that we find and share with one another from across the world wide web.

**We value diversity**, and we [make a point to surround ourselves with as many different people as we can](https://home.omg.lol/info/sponsorships). We believe that our community is made stronger because of our unique backgrounds and perspectives, and that we each gain so much by including people who are often overlooked or excluded from spaces predominantly occupied by one particular demographic or another. Our community is a beautiful mix of people with different ethnicities, different gender identities, and different disabilities and abilities, and we all learn so much from one another as a result of those differences.

**We value creativity** and the quirky human touch that can only come from making things ourselves. Most of us would rather build something ourselves than reach for an AI solution. We share the things that we create with one another, and we appreciate the humanity that we can see reflected back at us when we enjoy those things.

**We prioritize safety**, which means that we don‚Äôt put up with anything that jeopardizes anyone‚Äôs sense of security or well-being within the community. We have a [low level of tolerance](https://home.omg.lol/info/omg.lol/code-of-conduct) for those who would spend their time making others feel bad for nothing more than simply being who they are.

**We practice generosity** in different forms, with many freely giving their time and expertise to help others, and others [giving money to empower other causes and organizations to do their good work](https://home.omg.lol/giving).

Additionally: We don‚Äôt see ‚Äúwoke‚Äù as a slur, we believe that your pronouns are just as important as your name, and we absolutely do not tolerate even the slightest hint of fascism. We hold one another accountable for our mistakes, we‚Äôre not afraid to say ‚Äúsorry‚Äù when we‚Äôve done wrong, and we recognize that doing so is a strength and not a weakness.

And our overall vibe? [It‚Äôs super chill and super fun.](https://social.lol/public/local) Think ‚Äúcaf√© with friends making dad jokes‚Äù, not ‚Äúthought leaders at a tech conference‚Äù. (If you see yourself as a ‚Äúthought leader‚Äù, you almost certainly would hate it here. üòÑ) This caf√© can be experienced in equal parts on our Mastodon server and our [chat servers](https://home.omg.lol/info/chat), but you‚Äôll also see it reflected in people‚Äôs [profile pages](https://home.omg.lol/directory), [statuslog entries](https://status.lol), [pictures](https://some.pics), and [other fun places](https://url.town), too.

No community is perfect, and we‚Äôre definitely not going to be the first one to even come close. But we‚Äôll continue to be who we are, and doing what we do, and having a great time along the way. Maybe you‚Äôll join us, too, if this sounds like your kind of home. ‚ù§Ô∏è
