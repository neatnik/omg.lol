# Community Moderation

Our moderation team is available to assist with questions or concerns, as well as to address any concerns about anything within our social spaces. You can see our moderation team on our [staff page](https://home.omg.lol/staff).

## Getting help

You are welcome to contact any moderator, at any time, for any reason.

1. You can contact a moderator by emailing them at their omg.lol email address.
2. You can contact the entire moderation team by emailing `moderators@omg.lol`.
3. You can contact the moderation team _anonymously_ by emailing `omg.lol.modmail@email.engineering`. When you send a message to this address, only the subject line and body of your message will be relayed to the moderation team, youâ€™ll receive an automated confirmation reply, and your original email will be purged automatically. You can use this option to submit a concern without identifying yourself, but please understand that there is no way to follow up with you directly.
4. On social.lol, you can use the Report feature to submit a report to the moderation team.
5. On the omg.lol chat network, you can ping any moderator directly (on Discord, you can also ping the @Moderators role).

## Our approach to moderation

omg.lol moderators are here to keep our community safe. The moderation team helps to resolve conflicts and ensures that all members are participating according to our [Code of Conduct](/info/code-of-conduct). Safety is always a priority, and moderation decisions are rooted in maintaining member safety at all times.
